# Many Body Localization in a random Heisenberg chain
This Python-based program simulates the dynamics of a one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain, a widely studied model in condensed matter physics. The simulation is focused on exploring many-body localization (MBL), a phenomenon where disordered quantum systems fail to thermalize, leading to the preservation of local quantum information over long timescales.

The simulation uses the Lanczos algorithm, an efficient method for diagonalizing large sparse matrices, to study the Hamiltonian of the 1D Heisenberg model. This approach allows for the computation of key properties, such as energy levels, eigenstates, and time evolution, in systems with strong interactions and disorder.

The physical theory behind the simulation can be looked up in the paper. Feel free to email me if you have questions regarding the code.
