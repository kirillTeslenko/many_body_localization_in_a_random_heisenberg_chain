# many_body_localization_in_a_random_heisenberg_chain
This Python program simulates a 1D Heisenberg spin chain, exploring many-body localization (MBL) using the Lanczos algorithm. It models spin-1/2 interactions with random disorder to study non-thermalizing quantum states. The program efficiently computes eigenvalues and eigenvectors, making it ideal for studying MBL in disordered systems.
